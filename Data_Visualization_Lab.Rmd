## Read in Data

Read in the charm city circulator dataset:

`circ = read_csv("data/Charm_City_Circulator_Ridership.csv")`


```{r}
circ = read_csv("intro_R-main/Charm_City_Circulator_Ridership.csv")
# covert dates
circ = mutate(circ, date = mdy(date))
# change colnames for reshaping
colnames(circ) =  colnames(circ) %>% 
  str_replace("Board", ".Board") %>% 
  str_replace("Alight", ".Alight") %>% 
  str_replace("Average", ".Average") 

# make long
long = gather(circ, "var", "number", 
              starts_with("orange"),
              starts_with("purple"), starts_with("green"),
              starts_with("banner"))
# separate
long = separate(long, var, into = c("route", "type"), 
	sep = "[.]")
```

```{r}
## take just average ridership per day
avg = filter(long, type == "Average")
avg = filter(avg, !is.na(number))

# separate
type_wide = spread(long, type, value = number)
head(type_wide)
```


# Part 1

In these questions, try to use `ggplot2` if possible.

1. Plot average ridership (`avg` data set) by `date`.
```{r}
# geom_point
```

a. Color the points by route (`orange`, `purple`, `green`, `banner`)
```{r}


```

b. add black smoothed curves for each route
```{r}

```


c. Color the points by day of the week
```{r}

#avg = avg %>% mutate(dayFactor = factor(day, levels = c("Monday","Tuesday"...)))
# color = dayFactor
```


2. Replot 1a where the colors of the points are the name of the `route` (with `banner` --> `blue`)

```{r}
pal = c("blue", "darkgreen","orange","purple")


```

# Part 2

3. plot average ridership by date with one panel per `route`
```{r}
# facet_wrap = ~route

```
	  
4. Plot average ridership by date with separate panels by `day` of the week, colored by `route`
```{r}
# geom_point
#facet_wrap(~day)
```
	  
# Part 3


5. Plot average ridership (`avg`) by date, colored by `route` (same as 1a).  (do not take an average, use the average column for each route)
Make the x-label `"Year"`. Make the y-label `"Number of People"`. Use the black and white theme `theme_bw()`. Change the `text_size` to (`text = element_text(size = 20)`)
in `theme`
 
```{r} 

```

6. Plot average ridership on the `orange` route versus date
as a solid line, and add `dashed` "error" lines based 
on the `boardings` and `alightings.` 
the line colors should be `orange.`
(hint `linetype` is an aesthetic for lines) - see also `scale_linetype` and 
`scale_linetype_manual`
`Alightings = "dashed", Boardings = "dashed", Average = "solid"`
```{r}

```
